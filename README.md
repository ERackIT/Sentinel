# Microsoft Sentinel

Here you will find a toolbox of knowledge around using Microsoft Sentinel to it's full potential for an environment that contains more than just Microsoft.

###Purpose

The current focus of this repository is on 3rd Party Data Sources and logic apps using Threat Intelligence to enrich incidents.
