### Use Case
This is for when you want to generate alerts for alerts for alerts generated by another system.
This is assigning a Sentinel severity using the severity score assigned to alert by external system.
Useful reference if you need to assign a Sentinel severity score based on alternative parameters.


```
TableName
| where SourceIP !contains "192.10" //add exclusions parameters as needed 
| extend Score_toString  = tostring(score_d) //converting field to a string
| parse Score_toString with Score ".0" null  // creates 'Score' column and removes any trailing char after numbers
| extend NewScore=replace_regex(Score, @'([0-49]+(\d+))', @"Low") 
| extend NewScore=replace_regex(NewScore, @'([50-74]+(\d+))', @"Medium") 
| extend NewScore=replace_regex(NewScore, @'([75-99]+(\d+))', @"High") 

```

### Breakdown

*extend Score_toString  = tostring(score_d)*
Firstly, this parses out the number score into a string.

*parse Score_toString with Score ".0" null*
Next, this eternal system assigned a score between 1.0-100.0, so it had to have the trailing decimal removed.

*extend NewScore=replace_regex(Score, @'([0-49]+(\d+))', @"Low")*
Creates the 'NewScore' column and takes what's in the 'Score' column and converts any number between 0-49 to Low and puts it in the NewScore column.

*extend NewScore=replace_regex(NewScore, @'([50-74]+(\d+))', @"Medium")*
Takes what's in the 'NewScore' column and converts any number between 50-74 to Medium

*extend NewScore=replace_regex(NewScore, @'([75-99]+(\d+))', @"High") *
Takes what's in the 'NewScore' column and converts any number between 75-100 to High

If using this to create alerts, be sure to map the Incident serverity to the 'NewScore' column.
